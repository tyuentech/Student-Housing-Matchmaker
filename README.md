# Student Housing Matchmaker
A data science project for students in Chicago to provide housing options based on user preferences such as distance to campus, monthly rental price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and commute options.

## Overview
This project was made for a semester long data science class project. Our goal was to help college students in Chicago find ideal housing based on their own personal preferences. The methods behind it involved preparing our data, exploratory data analysis and visualizations, and machine learning analysis

## Technology
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, geopy)
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Our methodology and progress report can be seen [/notebooks](https://github.com/tyuentech/Student-Housing-Matchmaker/tree/main/notebooks)

## Data Sources
- Sample of rental listings in Chicago from Zillow
- Chicago Public Transit (Divvy Bike Stations, CTA Bus Stops, Chicago "L")
- Colleges in Chicago
Both raw and cleaned datasets can be found in the [/data](https://github.com/tyuentech/Student-Housing-Matchmaker/tree/main/data) folder.

## Visualizations and Machine Learning
Correlations between user preferences and apartment listings were found through various techniques. More about this can be read in our final report found here [View Final Report](https://github.com/tyuentech/Student-Housing-Matchmaker/blob/main/Student%20Housing%20Matchmaker%20Report.pdf)
